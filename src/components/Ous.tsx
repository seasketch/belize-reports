                        ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: To capture the value each sector places on
                        different areas of the nearshore, an Ocean Use Survey
                        was conducted. Individuals identified the sectors they
                        participate in, and were asked to draw the areas they
                        use relative to that sector and assign a value of
                        importance. Individual responses were then combined to
                        produce aggregate heatmaps by sector. This allows the
                        value of areas to be quantified, summed, and compared to
                        one another as more or less valuable.

                      <p>
                        Value is then used as a proxy for measuring the
                        potential economic loss to sectors caused by the
                        creation of protected areas. This report can be used to
                        minimize the potential impact of a plan on a sector, as
                        well as identify and reduce conflict between
                        conservation objectives and sector activities. The
                        higher the proportion of value within the plan, the
                        greater the potential impact to the fishery if access or
                        activities are restricted.
