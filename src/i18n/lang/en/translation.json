These zones are designated for habitats and species that may be rare, endangered, unique or with narrow distribution ranges. This zone includes breeding or spawning areas, key foraging habitat, fragile or sensitive species and habitats, and internationally significant areas. When combined, these zones provide habitats and species with long-term protection, and are sufficiently large to ensure ecological resilience and climate change adaptation. This zone category is not suitable for extraction or sea-bed alteration and is considered a no-take zone in common vernacular. Examples of high protection status, depending on the objectives and allowable human activities, are: Marine Protected Areas in the IUCN categories Ia, Ib, and II.</p><p>Medium biodiversity protection and sustainable use zones are proposed to conserve areas that are suitable for medium levels of biodiversity protection and are also compatible with some sustainable uses. These zones include habitats and species that have some tolerance to disturbance and human activities. These zones also include regionally and nationally significant areas. This zone category is suitable for some level of extraction and sea-bed alteration, with appropriate management and direction, depending on the objective of each designated area. Examples of medium protection status could include: Marine Protected Area IUCN categories V and VI, IUCN OECM category, and Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMA).</p><p>üéØ Planning Objective: None</p><p>üó∫Ô∏è Source Data: None</p><p>üìà Report: Simply counts number of zones in each protection level.</p>",
